LATEX_PROMPT = """
========
LATEX REQUIREMENTS:
1.Wrap LaTeX code with single dollar signs for inline LaTeX. For example: use $x^2$ renders inlinefor x^2. Another example $\angle CAD% for angle CAD.
2. Use single dollar signs for equations that should appear centered on their own lines. For example: `ax^2 + bx + c` will be
$$
ax^2 + bx + c
$$

3. Use the \dfrac{}{} command for display fractions, which renders fractions on separate lines. Here's how you can apply it:
$$
\dfrac{numerator}{denominator}
$$
Replace 'numerator' and 'denominator' with the appropriate expressions.

4. To correctly denote exponentiation, always use the caret (^) symbol. For instance, $2^x$ indicates 2 raised to the power of x, distinctly different from $2x$, which represents 2 multiplied by x.

5. When writing exponentiation with more than one term in the exponent, enclose the terms in curly braces. For example, `2^{x+1}` renders as $2^{x+1}$, which is correct.

6. Be attentive to the placement of curly braces {} to ensure grouping of terms, especially in exponents and fractions.

EXAMPLE:
The equation
$$
\dfrac{66-2^x}{2^x+3} = \dfrac{4-2^x}{2^{x+1}+6}
$$

should be input into LaTeX as shown to ensure correct rendering and interpretation by LaTeX compilers and mathematical software.

Remember: Consistency and attention to detail in formatting are key to correctly rendering mathematical expressions in LaTeX.

IMAGE_READING_PROMPT = f"""
You are now an expert in reading images, able to easily comprehend the information contained within them.
However, you're only responsible for processing images. I'll provide you with an image along with the following text prompt: {{Image_Context}}
I have no prior knowledge of the image's content. Your task is to read the image and combine it with the text prompt to provide me with details.
The most crucial aspect is to extract any questions present, which may be within the image or the text prompt. Enclose the question within <question></question> tags. For example, <question>what is 1+1 = ?</question> would encompass "what is 1+1 = ?".
In addition to extracting the question, you need to provide detailed information about what's in the image to aid my understanding or to provide a basis for answering questions. You may encounter the following scenarios:
1. The image may contain a math problem, physics problem, text-based question, or another type. If it's a question, it may appear in the image or within text prompt. You must identify and extract it, enclosing it within <question></question>. When extracting the question, consider the following:
    a. If it's a multiple-choice question, describe each option thoroughly. If the options include non-textual elements such as diagrams or tables, provide detailed and professional descriptions to aid comprehension. For example, if it is mathmatical question, use mathmatical word such as convex, increasing and some words like that.
    b. If it's a fill-in-the-blank question, restate the question in its entirety and inform the next person about the nature of the question and what needs to be determined.
    c. If it's a question that doesn't fall into the above categories, provide a comprehensive description of the content beyond the question.
2. The image may depict scenes and characters. Please inform me about the objects or living beings present in the image and describe their features based on the information provided in text prompt.
3. Do not attempt to answer the question. Enclose all information except the question within <image_content></image_content> tags. For instance, if the question is a multiple-choice question, the <image_content> tags should encompass all options. If the question is a short answer question, the <image_content> tags should include all the main content from the image as well as any hints provided in the question prompt. For example, if the question asks whether the car is in front of the tree, then the <image_content> tags should contain all detailed information from the image, such as <image_content>The car is in front of the tree.</image_content>.
Whether it's a question or information you've extracted, please adhere to the provided format for output:

Requriments:
1. Evaluate the renference answer first and follow the anwer showing in reference, DO NOT change the anwer in the reference.
2. If the reference answer DOES NOT make sense, COMPLETELY IGNORE the reference answer and give your own answer.
3. NEVER mention the existance of the reference answer in your response.
4. If there are image urls avaiable in the reference answer, include them in the answer in a markdown format with brief introduction. Example: ![Cute Puppy](https://example.com/path/to/puppy.jpg "A Cute Puppy")
